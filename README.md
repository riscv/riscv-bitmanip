# RISC-V Bitmanip (Bit Manipulation) Extension

This is the repository for the RISC-V Foundations Bitmanip Extension working group.

### NOTE: These RISC-V Bitmanip instructions are a work in progress.
These instructions and their specification may change before being accepted as a standard by the RISC-V Foundation and so it is highly likely that implementations made using this draft specification will not conform to the future standard.

## Instructions
The bitmanip instructions extend the RISC-V instruction set to enable efficent bit manipulation.
This includes operations like:
 * counting bits, leading zeros, etc
 * bit extraction
 * rotations, shifting and reversing

## Specification 
See [bitmanip-draft.pdf](bitmanip-draft.pdf) for a pre-built version
of the PDF spec document.
The source of the PDF specification is in the [specification](specification) directory with a Makefile and script (bitmanip.sh) to build the PDF.

## Verilog Reference
The [verilog](verilog) directory includes Verilog reference implementations.

## cproofs
The [cproofs](cproofs) directory contains a few proofs for the reference C models.

## riscvOVPsim Reference Simulation
Included in this repository in the directory [riscv-ovpsim](riscv-ovpsim) is a version of the Imperas [riscvOVPsim](riscv-ovpsim/README.md) simulator that includes a full implementation of the RISC-V 32 & 64 Bit ISA specification and an implementation of these new bitmanip instructions. 

To enable the new instructions, just add a command line option:

    riscvOVPsim.exe --extensionb

And in the log you will see it enabled, for example:

    Info (RISCV_EXTB) extB Version(0.37-Draft) March 22 2019

This simulation is instruction accurate, is provided as a pre-compiled binary, and the source of the new instructions in the model can be found in [extB.c](Imperas/ImperasLib/source/riscv.ovpworld.org/intercept/extB/1.0/model/extB.c). If you want to make changes to the instructions, please contact the working group chair or [Imperas](mailto:info@imperas.com).

NOTE the instruction behavior and decodes will change before they become part of the RISC-V open standard ISA.

## Building the Specification PDF
In order to produce the Specification pdf run he following command

    $ make document

## Issues or more information
Please add an issue to this repository or email the normal bitmanip working group alias.

## Instruction Assembler Tests
Many assembly tests are included ([asmtests](asmtests)) that provide directed and generated tests for the new instructions. There is a simple framework to run the tests and compare them with a golden logfile.

## Building and Running the Instruction Assembler Tests
To start, you need to set up the search path to include the path to a RISCV Compiler, eg:

    $ export PATH=${PATH}:/home/tools/riscv-none-embed/bin
    
Also you need a variable to define the canonical compiler prefix, eg:

    $ export RISCV_PREFIX=riscv-none-embed-
    
And then you run the tests:

    $ make runtest
    
This process is self checking, and will report a set of passing/failing tests at the end:

    Test Passed andc
    Test Passed autoasm
    Test Passed bdep
    Test Passed bext
    Test Passed cbrev
    Test Passed clz
    Test Passed cneg
    Test Passed cnot
    Test Passed ctz
    Test Passed grev
    Test Passed grevi
    Test Passed gzip
    Test Passed pcnt
    Test Passed rol
    Test Passed ror
    Test Passed rori
    Test Passed shfl
    Test Passed shfli
    Test Passed slo
    Test Passed sloi
    Test Passed sro
    Test Passed sroi
    Summary: All Tests Passed

## Clean Sandbox
To remove all generated files:

    $ make clean
