# RISC-V Bitmanip (Bit Manipulation) Extension

This is the RISC-V Bitmanip Extension draft spec. The spec aims to
extend the RISC-V instruction set to enable efficent bit manipulation.
This includes operations like;
 * counting bits, leading zeros, etc
 * bit extraction
 * rotations, shifting and reversing

See [bitmanip-draft.pdf](bitmanip-draft.pdf) for a pre-built version
of the PDF spec document.
