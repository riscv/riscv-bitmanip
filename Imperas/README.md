This directory contains the structure and source files defining the bitmanip extension instructions. 

The structure is that needed by the Imperas simulator build system used to create riscvOVPsim and the other RISC-V Imperas simulators. This directory tree is copied to an Imperas installation to add the bitmanip functionality to the simulator.

The instructions are defined in the [extB.c](ImperasLib/source/riscv.ovpworld.org/intercept/extB/1.0/model/extB.c) file.
