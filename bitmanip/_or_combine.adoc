==== OR Combine

*orc.b* sets the bits of each byte in the result _rd_ to all zeros if no bit within the respective byte of _rs_ is set, or to all ones if any bit within the respective byte of _rs_ is set.

One use-case is string-processing functions, such as *strlen* and *strcpy*, which can use *orc.b* to test for the terminating zero byte by counting the set bits in leading non-zero bytes in a word.
